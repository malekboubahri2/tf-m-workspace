# App Directory

This folder contains the application source code for the project.  

**Important Notes:**

- The `app/` folder is **ignored by Git** in this repository (`.gitignore`).  
- Each subproject or module under `app/` will be **version controlled in separate repositories**.  
- Changes to the code here **should be committed and tracked in their respective repositories**, not in this main container repo.  

This structure allows independent development and versioning of different applications while keeping the container repository clean.
